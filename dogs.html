                    <p><em>The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse 
                        variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the 
                        World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between 
                        dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion 
                        as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies 
                        even show medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved 
                        lipid profiles. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you 
                        care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough 
                        opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more information 
                        about how to care for your pets throughout the various stages of their 
                        lives.</em>

                        Throughout dogs' lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they 
                        mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to 
                        three meals per day when they are about three to six months years old. Their 
                        food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months 
                        to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year 
                        old. And a dog's typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 
                        70 percent water. The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a> says just a 10 percent decrease in body water 
                        can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you 
                        keep your pooch hydrated!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their 
                        organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time 
                        for exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a 
                        range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine 
                        exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you 
                        reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, 
                        exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up 
                        contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys 
                        to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do 
                        not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require 
                        supervision.

                        Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be 
                        sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent 
                        matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. 
                        Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily 
                        wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be 
                        an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap 
                        out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is 
                        formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic 
                        reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter 
                        the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If 
                        you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and 
                        the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the 
                        belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to 
                        support the chest and rear as you lift.

                        You should <strong>always</strong> consult with your veterinarian, but 
                        there is a core set of vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines 
                        that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and 
                        parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the 
                        environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">
                        Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</a>
