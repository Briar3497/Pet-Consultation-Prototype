                    <p><em>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and 
                        are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. 
                        While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can 
                        differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally 
                        recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of 
                        breed.</em>

                        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is 
                        either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor 
                        your kitten's growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing 
                        steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker 
                        might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding 
                        tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include 
                        the following:

                        <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around 
                        three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this 
                        age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of 
                        wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, 
                        a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is 
                        optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed 
                        for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have 
                        different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your 
                        veterinarian for recommendations.

                    <h2 id="one-year-to-seven-years">One Year to Seven Years</h2>
                    <p>
                        This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. 
                        At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. 
                        It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, 
                        provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking 
                        throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other 
                        weight-related feline ailments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience 
                        a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more 
                        quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your 
                        cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and <strong>not</strong> 
                        just a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or 
                        combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
